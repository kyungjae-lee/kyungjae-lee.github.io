## Examples

### Example 1-1

Program to input and output mixed data types to a file.

```cpp
//
// Program to input and output mixed data types.
// Types: string, char, integer, float, double
//
// Output format operations: left, setprecision(), setfill(), setw() and fixed.
//

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    string firstname;
    string lastname;
    char initial;
    unsigned int employee_no;
    float wage, hours;
    double pay;
    char answer = 'y';

    // Write employee data to a file

    ofstream outfile;   // Declare a file pointer for output

    // Open a path for output
    outfile.open("./employee.txt");
    // Both absolute/relative paths work. If you put the file name only, the
    // program will create the file in the same directory as this source file
    // is located.
    // It's not unusual to see this operation fails. If that's the case check
    // if the path is correct, if the folder exists.
    // You can still create a file with extensions 'docx', 'xlsx' but that
    // doesn't mean that MS Word or Excel can recognize it.
    // 'dat', 'txt' are the safe ones.

    // Always test if the file has opened successfully
    // If failed, you don't want to further move on with your code.
    if (!outfile)
    {
        cout << "ERROR - Unable to open output file. " << endl;
        system("pause");
        return 1; // To indicate something not desirable happend.
        // By convention, when everything went well, return 0;
    }
    // If everything went well up to this point, you are now ready to use the
    // file.

    cout << "File opened for write" << endl << endl;

    do
    {
        cout << "Enter the following information for each employee:\n";
        cout << "LastName FirstName MiddleInitial IDNumber Wage HoursWorked";
        cout << endl;

        cin >> lastname >> firstname >> initial >> employee_no >> wage >> hours;

        // All of the manipulators work on files just as they do when you print
        // to the screen.
        // Formatting setup
        outfile << fixed << left << setfill('.') << setprecision(2);
        outfile << setw(20) << "Last Name: " << lastname << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "First Name: " << firstname << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "Middle Initial: " << initial << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "ID Number: " << employee_no << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "Wage Per Hour: " << wage << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "Hours Worked: " << hours << endl;
        // cout goes to the screen, file handle goes to the file

        pay = hours * wage;

        outfile << "Pay for the week $" << fixed << setprecision(2) << pay
            << endl << endl;

        cout << "Do you want to enter data for another employee? (Y/N)"
            << endl;
        cin >> answer;

        cout << endl;

    } while (answer == 'Y' || answer == 'y');

    outfile.close();    // close the file in a secure way.

    system("pause");

    return 0;
}
```

### Example 1-2

Program to append data to an existing file.

```cpp
//
// Program to append data to an existing file.
// Types: string, char, integer, float, double
//
// Output format operations: left, setprecision(), setfill(), setw() and fixed.
//

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    string firstname;
    string lastname;
    char initial;
    unsigned int employee_no;
    float wage, hours;
    double pay;
    char answer = 'y';

    // Declare a file pointer for output
    ofstream outfile;
    // Open a path for output (append to an existing file)
    outfile.open("./employee.txt", ios::app);
    if (!outfile)
    {
        cout << "ERROR - Unable to open output file. " << endl;
        system("pause");
        return 1;
    }

    cout << "File opened for write (append to an existing file)"
        << endl << endl;

    do
    {
        cout << "Enter the following information for each employee:\n";
        cout << "LastName FirstName MiddleInitial IDNumber Wage HoursWorked";
        cout << endl;

        cin >> lastname >> firstname >> initial >> employee_no >> wage >> hours;

        // All of the manipulators work on files just as they do when you print
        // to the screen.
        // Formatting setup
        outfile << fixed << left << setfill('.') << setprecision(2);
        outfile << setw(20) << "Last Name: " << lastname << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "First Name: " << firstname << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "Middle Initial: " << initial << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "ID Number: " << employee_no << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "Wage Per Hour: " << wage << endl;
        outfile << setw(20) << "Hours Worked: " << hours << endl;
        // cout goes to the screen, file handle goes to the file

        pay = hours * wage;

        outfile << "Pay for the week $" << fixed << setprecision(2) << pay
            << endl << endl;

        cout << "Do you want to enter data for another employee? (Y/N)"
            << endl;
        cin >> answer;

        cout << endl;

    } while (answer == 'Y' || answer == 'y');

    outfile.close();    // close the file in a secure way.

    system("pause");

    return 0;
}
```

```text

### Example 2

Program to read from an existing file and print the data.

```cpp
// Program to read and print data from a file
//
// Introduces fstream, file open, file read, file close.
//
// NOTE: The data file temps.txt must be saved into the Temp/Data directory
// before running this program.
//

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ifstream infile;    // Declare a file pointer
    infile.open("temps.txt");
    if (!infile)
    {
        cout << "Error - Could not open input file." << endl;
        system("pause");
        return 1;
    }

    cout << "Input file opened." << endl;

    float temperature = 0.0;

    // Set the output format
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);

    // While we have not reached the end of file
    while (!infile.eof())
    {
        infile >> temperature;  // Reads a number from the file
        cout << temperature << endl;
    }

    infile.close(); // close the data file

    system("pause");

    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3

Program to copy a file.

```cpp
//
// Program that copies a file
// This program reads an existing file and writes another file that is a copy.
// It illustrates how to deal with multiple files in one program.
// The program requires the file 'HistoryUAH.txt' in the current folder.
// 

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    string word;
    string line;
    unsigned int word_count = 0;
    unsigned int line_count = 0;

    // Open the text files
    ifstream textfile;
    ofstream textout;

    // Open the existing text file
    textfile.open("objective.txt");

    // Verify that the file was opened.
    if (!textfile)
    {
        cout << "Unable to open the file." << endl;
        system("pause");
        return 1;
    }

    // Now open the new output file.
    textout.open("objective_copy.txt");

    // Verify that the file was opened.
    if (!textout)
    {
        cout << "Error - Output file could not open." << endl;
        system("pause");
        return 1;
    }

    // ------------------ PART 1. READ THE FILE WORD BY WORD ------------------ 

    // Copy each word of the input file by reading them in one at a time
    // and writing them out to the screen and to the new file.
    // Note that we are not writing any line feeds (endl) to the file.

    cout << endl << "Part One " << endl;
    textout << endl << "Part One " << endl;

    while (!textfile.eof())
    {
        // Read on word from the file
        textfile >> word;

        // Write it to the screen. Here we are writing an endl after each word.
        cout << ": " << word << endl;

        // Write the same word to the file adding a space after each word.
        textout << word << " ";

        // Count the words too.
        word_count++;
    }

    cout << "There are " << word_count << " words in the file." << endl;
    

    // ------------------ PART 2. READ THE FILE WITH GETLINE ------------------ 

    // Reset the file to the beginning
    textfile.seekg(0, ios::beg);    // File close and re-open would do the same
    textfile.clear();   // Clear the error flags that might have come up while 
                        // reading the file in the previous steps.

    cout << endl << "Part Two " << endl;
    textout << endl << "Part Two " << endl;

    // Read the first line from the file
    getline(textfile, line);

    while (!textfile.eof())
    {
        line_count++;

        // How long is the line?
        cout << "Line " << line_count << " has " << line.length()
            << " characters." << endl;
        cout << line << endl;

        // Write the line to the output file
        // Make sure to feed 'endl' at the end of each line because 'getline'
        // does not read in the end-of-line character.
        textout << line << endl;

        // Read the next line from the file
        getline(textfile, line);
        // If you have your first getline at the beginning of the while loop
        // problem will occur. Think! Make sure to have one before the while
        // loop starts, and the other at the end of the while loop.
    }

    cout << "There are " << line_count << " lines in the file." << endl;

    // Now, close both files.
    textfile.close();
    textout.close();

    cout << endl << endl;
    system("pause");

    return 0;
}
