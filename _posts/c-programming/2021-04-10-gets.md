## Reading Strings Using gets()

Like scanf(), gets() reads input characters into an array, then stores a null
character. In other respects, however, gets() is somewhat different from
scanf():
- gets() doesn't skip white space before starting to read the string (scanf()
  does).
- gets() reads until it finds a new-line character (scanf() stops at any
  white-space character). In addition, gets() discards the new-line character
  instead of storing it in the array; the null character takes its place.
