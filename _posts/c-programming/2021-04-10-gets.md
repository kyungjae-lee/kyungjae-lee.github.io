## Reading Strings Using gets()

Like scanf(), gets() reads input characters into an array, then stores a null
character. In other respects, however, gets() is somewhat different from
scanf():
- gets() doesn't skip white space before starting to read the string (scanf()
  does).
- gets() reads until it finds a new-line character (scanf() stops at any
  white-space character). In addition, gets() discards the new-line character
  instead of storing it in the array; the null character takes its place.

### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define STR_LEN 20

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char str1[STR_LEN + 1];
    char str2[STR_LEN + 1];

    printf("Enter a sentence: ");
    scanf("%s", str1);
    gets(str2);

    printf("%s\n", str1);
    printf("%s\n", str2);

    return 0;
}
```

Input
```text
Enter a sentence: This is a sentence.
```

Output
```text
This
 is a sentence.

```
