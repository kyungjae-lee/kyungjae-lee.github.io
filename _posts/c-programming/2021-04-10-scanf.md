## scanf() 

Formatted Read

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int scanf(const char *restrict format, ...);
```
- Reads input items from the stdin stream. The string pointed to by format
  specifies the format of the items to be read. The arguments that follow
  format point to objects in which the items are to be stored.
- Returns the number of input items successfully read and stored. Returns EOF
  if an input failure occurs before any items can be read.

## scanf() Idiom

Loop that reads a series of integers on by one, stopping at the first sign of
trouble:

```c
while (scanf("%d", &i) == 1)
{
    ...
}
```

## How scanf() Works with the White-Space Characters

White-space characters include the space, horizontal and vertical tab,
form-feed, and new-line characters.

For each conversion specification in the format string, scanf() tries to locate
an item of the appropriate type in the input data, skipping blank space
(white-space characters) if necessary.
```c
int i, j;
scanf("%d%d", &i, &j);
/*
 * Valid input may be,
 *    - 10 20
 *    -     10 20
 *    - 10    20
 *    - 10
 *        20
 *
 * Invalid input may be,
 *    - 10,20
 *    - 10 / 20
 */
```

A non-white-space character other than % matches the same character in the
input stream.

```c
int i, j;
scanf("%d/%d", &i, &j);
/*
 * Valid input may be,
 *    - 10/20
 *    -     10/20
 *    - 10/   20
 *    - 10/
 *        20
 * 
 * Invalid input may be,
 *    - 10 /20
 *    - 10 /    20
 *    - 10 /
 *        20
 */
```
- For example, input stream ' 10 /20' won't match the format string "%d/%d".
    1. scanf() skips one space
    2. matches %d with 10
    3. then, attempts to match the / in the format string with a space in the
       input
    4. there's no match, so scanf() puts the space back (the ' /20' characters
       remain to be read by the next call of scanf())
- To allow spaces after the first number, the format string "%d /%d" should
  be used instead

One or more consecutive white-space characters in a scanf() format string match
zero or more white-space characters in the input stream. 
```c
int i, j;
scanf("%d /%d", &i, &j);
/*
 * Valid input may be,
 *    - 10/20
 *    -     10/20
 *    - 10 /20
 *    - 10    /    20
 *
 * Invalid input may be,
 *    - 10,20
 *    - 10 , 20
 */ 
```

## Reading Strings Using scanf()

The %s conversion specification allows scanf() to read a string into a character
array:

```c
char str[50] = { 0 };
scanf("%s", str);
```
When scanf() is called, it skips white space, then reads characters and stores
them in str until it encounters a white-space character. scanf() always stores
a null character at the end of the string.

A string read using scanf() will never contain white space. Consequently,
scanf() won't usually read a full line of input; a new-line character will 
cause scanf() to stop reading, but so will a space or tab character.

To read an entire line of input at a time, gets() might be a better choice.

### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define STR_LEN 20

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char str1[STR_LEN + 1];
    char str2[STR_LEN + 1];

    printf("Enter a sentence: ");
    scanf("%s", str1);
    gets(str2);

    printf("%s\n", str1);
    printf("%s\n", str2);

    return 0;
}
```

Input
```text
Enter a sentence: This is a sentence.
```

Output
```text
This
 is a sentence.

```
