## printf() Conversion Specifiers

### Flags (optional; more than one permitted)

### Minimum Field Width (Optional)

* Output item < field width
    - Right justified within the field
* Output item > field width
    - Still displayed in its entirety
* The field width is either an integer or character \*. If \* is present, the
  field width is obtained from the next argument. If this argument is negative,
  it's treated as a positive number preceded by a - flag.


### Precision (Optional)

The precision is a period (.) followed by an integer or the character \*. If \*
is present, the precision is obtained from the next argument. (If this argument
is negative, the effect is the same as not specifying a precision.)

The meaning of precision depends on the conversion (specifier):

* d, i, o, u, x, X
    - Minimum number of digits (leading zeros are added if the number has fewer
      digits)
* a, A, e, E, f, F
    - Number of digits after the decimal point
* g, G
    - Number of significant digis
* s
    - Maximum number of bytes

[!] Note: If only the period (.) is present, the precision is zero.

### Length Modifier

The presence of a length modifier inditcates that the item to be displayed has
a type that's longer or shorter than is normal for a particular conversion
specification.
* e.g., %d normally refers to an *int* value;
    - %hd is used to display a *short int* 
    - %ld is used to display a *ling int*

### Conversion Specifier



## printf() Statement on Multiple Lines

When a string literal in a printf() is too long to fit in one line of code, it
can be splited into multiple lines.

```c
printf("This is how a "
    "long string literal"
    " can be splited into multiple lines.\n");
```
