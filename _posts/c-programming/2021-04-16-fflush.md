## Using fflush() on an Input Stream 

The POSIX and C standards explicitly state that using fflush() on an input
stream is undefined behavior. Although, some implementation allow the use of
fflush() to flush unread input, it's not a good idea to assume that all do. 
fflush() is designed to flush output streams.

```c
fflush(stdin);    /* effect is undefined */

FILE *fp = fopen("text.txt", "rt");
...
fflush(fp);       /* effect is undefined */
```


## Customized Function as an Alternative to fflush() on an Input Stream

Following user-defined function reads and ignores all characters up to (and
including) the first new-line character:

```c
void skip_line(void)
{
    while (getchar() != '\n')
        ;    
}
```

scanf() can also be used, but as scanf() leaves the new-line character unread
user may have to discard it separately.

```c
scanf("%*[^\n]");    /* skips characters up to new-line */
```
