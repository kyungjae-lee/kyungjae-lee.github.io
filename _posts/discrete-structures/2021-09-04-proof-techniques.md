## Proof Techniques

**Proof**
* An impeccable argument.
* Use only methods of pure logic.
* Infers the validity of a given mathematical assertion.

**Axiom**
* A Proposition regarded as self-evidently true without proof.

### 1. Counterexample

* Counterexample of a conjecture P(x) â†’ Q(x) is a case in which P is true but Q
is false. 
* One counterexample is enough to disprove a conjecture.
    - Find one example that the proposition does not hold true, then it is
      generally not true.
* If a counterexample is not forthcoming, perhaps the conjecture is true and we
should try to prove it!

### 2. Exhaustive Proof

### 3. Direct Proof

### 4. Contraposition

### 5. Contradiction

### 6. Serendipity
