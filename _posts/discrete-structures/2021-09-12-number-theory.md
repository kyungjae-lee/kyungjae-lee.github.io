## Common Definitions

* A **perfect square** is an integer *n* such that *n = k^2* for some integer
  *k*.
* A **prime number** is an integer *n > 1* such that *n* is not divisible by
  any integers other than *1* and *n*.
* A **composite number** *n* is a nonprime integer; that is, *n = ab* where *a*
  and *b* are integers with *1 < a < n* and *1 < b < n*.
* For two numbers *x* and *y*, *x* < *y* means *y - x > 0*.
* For two integers *n* and *m*, *n* **divides** *m*, *n*|*m*, means that *m* is
  divisible by *n* - that is, *m = kn* for some integer *k*.
* The **absolute value** of a number *x*, |*x*|, is *x* if *x â‰¥ 0* and is *-x*
  if *x < 0*.
