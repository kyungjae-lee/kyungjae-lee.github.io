## Statement (or Proposition)

A statement (or proposition) is a declarative sentence that can be determined
or evaluated to be either true or false.

Followings are statements.
* Ten is less than seven. (False)
* Seoul is the capital of South Korea. (True)
* There are life forms on other planets in the universe. (Either true or false;
  we do not have to be able to decide which.)

Followings are NOT statements. Use this rule!
* The number X is positive. (X is not known)
* He is a baseball pitcher. (Do not know who 'he' is)
* Are you a Freshmen? (Questions are definitely not statements.)
    * You are a Freshmen. (If who 'you' is known, it is a statement.)
* Leave the room. (Command)

## Statement Letters

Uppercase letters such as A, B and C that are used to represent the statements.

## Logical Connectives

* Disjunction - A∨B (read "A or B")
    - A, B - disjuncts
* Conjunction - A∧B (read "A and B")
    - A, B - conjuncts
* Negation - A' (read "not A")
    - ~ or bar over the top of the object or propositional variable may be used
* Implication - if...then (→), A→B (read "A implies B")
    - A - hypothesis, antecedent, sufficient condition
    - B - conclusion, consequent, necessary condition
* Equivalence - if and only if (↔), A↔B stands for (A→B)∧(B→A) 

NOT(unary connective) needs only one statement whereas others(binary connectives)
must have at least two statements.
